# Assignment for a Data candidate
## Fleet Management System (FMS) & Connected Commercial Vehicles 


### Optimizing operations for fleets is a big challenge for fleet managers. Logistic companies are constrained by a small margin and any decision should be driven by cost, sustainability, safety, etc. Use your skills to build a recommender system that helps a fleet manager to optimize the logistics operations.

The task of a fleet manager is to make sure all resources such as vehicles, and drivers have been used in an optimum way. It is often a challenge for them to access a powerful intelligent tool as a support system to help them to make the best decision. Often times there are multiple factors which play a role and would require a sophisticated intelligence to handle and analyze and provide insights. Among all, few factors to name here are: drivers’ behaviors, driving situations (highway, city, weather, geolocation, etc.), vehicle condition and type, vehicles’ fuel/battery status. Here we want you to build a solution to suggest the best combination of drivers and vehicles pair based on a driving situation in order to optimize the fleet operation efficiency.

We challenge you to create a software that would help a fleet manager to be operate the fleet in a most efficient way: Invent an intelligent algorithm for efficient operation prediction (fuel consumption as an example), paired with a visualisation and Driving behavior scoring and recommending a best use of resources for a fleet.

### Background 

Our [Digital Fleet Management Solution](https://www.zf.com/products/en/cv/fleet/fleet_emea.html) develops and commercializes digital transport services for fleets and logistics sector. We are a global full solution provider of truck, driver, trailer, cargo and subcontractor management.

The component of the commercial vehicles (truck & trailers) are connected and continuosly transmit data to the cloud over the status and their condition:

Let's describe it in more details in the following what we mean by Fleets' efficiency in operation.

Commercial vehicle fleets (heavy duty vehicles for Cargo transport) are becoming ever more connected, allowing for collection of data sources such as fuel consumption, driving condition, driver behaviour, braking events, location, etc., to name just a few.
The cost of this increased connectivity eats into the already-small margins of most fleets, but how could be used to a fleet's advantage?

The folllowing is a schematic image of fuel/energy consumption distribution by multiple drivers:

As shown, driving behaviour is one of the important driver to the fuel consumption. Every fleet manager would like to have a such a picture according to the historical fleet operations and optimized the efficiency and sustainability. The main challenge is to provide enough evidence to the fleet manager to decide based on the data in the past. Hence the fleet manager would be able to optimize his/her resources, i.e., connect a right driver to a right trip and vehicle. 


### Problem statement

*Question:* How might we help the fleet manager use their fleet data to reduce their operating costs and improve efficiency? 

*Challenge:* Develop an algorithm that utilises driving scores and optimises driver-vehicle pair as a recommender system.

*Hints:*
- Start with a clear business case/idea definition (few slides when presenting to us).
<!--- - Focus on identifying how connecting vehicle data to alternative data sources can add value. -->
- Provide us with a your script completeing python notebook provided in the attachment. 


### Data provided

- Description of data columns provided in excel format (Description_data_ZF.xlsx).
- Vehicle fuel consumption data, aggregated at trip-based level, i.e., how much fuel consumed during various trip missions (defined by ignition on/off) of the vehicle. We split the data into a trip data (Trip_data.csv) and Driving behavior data based on the vehicle CAN-BUS and sensors data (Driving_behavior.csv).
<!--- - Dashboard available in Power BI (ZF_powerbi.pbix). -->

<!---  The Dataset contains >15000 trips, 43 vehicles, and 178 drivers (available in power bi data table sheet as well). -->


### Goal

In visualization below some insights are seen on various factors playing a role for the fuel consumption at a descriptive level. As a first goal one can clasify the features which are contributing on the driving behavior, that is:

The trips (vehicle missions) can be clustered as depicted below based on varios feature and a so-called K-means metric:

One of the goal here could be to build up a model to demonstrate how much driving behavior contributes positively on classifying the trips or drivers. Therefore one can estimate the contribution of the driving behavior on the fuel consumption.


### Our expectation

- Python notebook with steps defined.
- Presentation with a clear problem statement & solution definition.
- Provide Illustration of results as much as possible.


The solution should serve a fleet manager to optimize the fleet operation.
